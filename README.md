# DUA in Semantic Segmentation Networks
This project includes the control component of a simplified version of a self-driving car. The racetrack contains landmarks. Landmarks within a fixed radius are relayed to the control component. The control component 
was realised via a small neural network in Tensorflow. [Video](https://box.hu-berlin.de/d/edda75d65d3c44708971/)
